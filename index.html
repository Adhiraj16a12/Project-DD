            <h2>Social Media Addiction</h2>
            <div>
                <div class="image_wrapper"><img src="./images/instagram.jpg"/></div>
                <p><em>Media addiction has been a trend now , it has been rapidly increasing in teens and it just does not seem to slow down! People cannot even stay a day without scrolling through media , there are over 1.3 billion users on social media and at first it seemed like a small problem because very less people were getting addicted but it has been increasing over the last decade owing over 10% users to be addicted to it which is roughly around 130 million which might seem a small number but it has been increasing in activity like I said before. Social addiction is categorized as a behavioral addiction which is basically you have to check what is going on. There is an urge to see messages and many people cannot even go beyond 7 hours without logging into their social media account , controlling the urge sometimes might cause a rise in temper and disconnect you from the world. It boycotts you from the real world and this is counted as a disorder which reduces your emotion tolerance , behavioral cognitive and some symptoms for the same can be change in regular mood and internal conflict. Media addiction can also be said to be as effective as dopamine as multiple studies show platforms like FaceBook and Instagram produce neural activity which is similar to circuits caused by gambling and drug consumption , studies also state that constant media can trigger chemical reactions similar to drugs like cocaine and this has been doubled by neuroscientists. </em></p>

            <div>
                <p> Developing a sense of belonging promotes synergy and the well-being of a community. The way it is related to the SOI is that when a society doesn’t accept you, you will get bullied by default for being an outcast. Sometimes introverted people don't really have a sense of belonging to the community, and thus it mentally and emotionally damages them. One can, however, try their best to connect to the community, which will help them develop their self-esteem, promote development in their social circles and thus promote a sense of belonging, which is for the betterment of the community because sometimes it only takes the view of one person to help us understand a solution to a problem. This promotes collaboration.</p>

            <h2>Effects of Social media addiction</h2>
            <p>5-10% users at social media cannot log off which is roughly around 50 million , this is a psychological disorder or addiction , brain scans have shown proof that their neural circuits are similar to people who take in drugs etc.

                Social media gives you attention and rewards with simple tasks , your brain rewires to give you an urge or desire to log onto social media.
                
                You begin to crave more of it which is like a drug.
                
                It is rewiring your whole nervous system, for example Phantom Vibration symptom happens when you  get an itch or urge in your leg which is similar to a phone vibration all thanks to waiting for it on social media.
                
                It releases dopamine which becomes much more active when they use social media as they are discussing and talking about themselves instead of listening to other people. 
                
                It separates you from the real world.
                
                It does not affect only one body system it affects your whole body ,  your nervous system starts to rewire itself. Your brain is also rewiring itself and the RH radiation it releases provides your whole body a higher than usual body temperature. Ever tried touching your forehead after watching the screen for hours? Try it , you will feel like touching a frying pan. Your fingers are also affected which are part of the muso-skeletal system and your heart/digestive system is also affected. Want to know why? The reason the heart which is part of the circulatory system and your digestive system is affected is because less productive activity means you will not spill out your carbs thus making them into fats which are bad for your heart and body as a whole , no activity also affects your metabolism making it slower AND to conclude if your heart does not function properly the body won’t either causing different diseases and also causing your body systems to fail slowly but eventually. </p>
                
                Sure it has made life and communication much easier as you can share and send messages with one click now instead of waiting days but these facts will make you rethink!

Harassment and abuse is public and legal in social media thus many people experience cyberbullying from people who purposely want to make them feel bad about who they are . They are not physically present or harming you in anyways but they impact your brain and how you think.

Many studies show even though social media is made to boost one's morale , self confidence and worth they experience loneliness and anxiety in the real world. The reason for it is many people are addicted to it and have a fear to miss out on something important like seeing your friends play games , many people constantly want social media even after they leave it due to this it creates anxiety in many people and a lot are not able to socialize properly with people face to face/direct communication.

Ah this is not one of the most BUT the most important thing. Echo chambers , people start to isolate themselves from the real world because they don't want to be judged and many of them unfriend their best friends because they just don’t agree with them.It effects our thought process and privacy , many people don't remain open minded to ideas and other people communicating with them because they don't want be wrong.

            <h2> Solution</h2>
            <p>Delete apps, or disable notifications from social media: Most people check into social media mindlessly, so put a small barrier in the way by turning off notifications. If you don't see a social media icon or alert every time you pick up your phone, you're less likely to spend time there. Set limits and stick to them. Figure out your purpose and values and stay connected to those
                This is my way of saying what Nir Eyal would label ‘Going from Distraction to Traction’. Take the time to figure out what your Purpose is — that is to say; what a higher goal is for you in your life that you can feel inspired by. What are your values? What is the value you can create for people around you?
                Start looking at ways to use your technology aligned with your Purpose and Values, in stead of reactively.
                Read Nir Eyal’s ‘Indistractable’ to understand more about the need to understand to go from Distraction to Traction: spending more time on the people and activities that matter most to you.
                From there on out: ask yourself the question on the regular: is what I’m spending my time and attention on right now aligned with my Purpose and Values, or not?
                I’d also advise you to to journal daily, using a little notebook — preferably physical (like a Bambook) but digital if you must, to help stay connected to your sense of purpose and your values — journaling has been proven to help you make small choices based on those instead of on the slings and arrows of daily life.
                Figure out your most important relationships; structure, and align your time and attention spend
                Environmental design goes beyond the design of your physical and digital environment, as it pertains to habit formation. It’s also — to a very large and influential extent — about the design of your social environment.
                Take the time to look at your social environment; your first circle of 5; your closest relationships — at home and at work; your 15 closest relationships; your circle of 50 friends and family members, and so on.
                Which of these relationships matter most to you? Which matter most to your Purpose and values as you have defined them? Now, how are you spending and allocating your time across these different circles and relationships? Write it down, check your calendar, and then check your values.
                Next to that, if you’re serious about using technology less, or using technology in a more Purpose-driven and balanced way, it can be very wise to make your direct social environment a part of that. Make sure your spouse or your boss or coworkers know you’re trying to be offline more. Talk to your children, give them a healthy example.
                Go one step beyond that, and find one or more peer-to-peer coaches or accountability-buddies for yourself, as the app FocusMate would have you do on their platform. Have regular, short accountability meetings with your peer-to-peer coach and help each other stay on track with your goals.
                Figure out what time you need for self-care
                To be the best you can be, to stick to your plans and your carefully designed new habits — you need to be well-rested. As happy as possible. Energetic and inspired. This works for quitting a social media addiction, but just as well for quitting smoking, alcohol, et cetera.
                Assess how much time you need for self-care; mental, physical, emotional — to rest, to recharge, to work out; to hang out, to do nothing, to eat healthily — or to cheat on your diet and just enjoy yourself — and plan that time. Include time for lame stuff like administration, taxes, and house cleaning chores. Cluttered spaces and administrative/financial stresses are the opposite of self-care.
                In general, nothing spells: “I’m not gonna stick to my new habits” as clearly as a tired, strung-out, stressed you. Use your p2p coach as a check; first and foremost at every p2p coaching session or accountability-meeting you should be asking each other: “How have you been taking care of yourself?”
                Strategically plan & automate your work
                Have you ever taken the time to look at how you use your time at work? To look at what tasks take up the most of your time, and to check these tasks along the measures of a. where do you create the most value, and b. what tasks align best with your personal goals or purpose, and those of your team and the broader organization?
                So often we simply spend our time the way we simply spend our time, and often based on what seems urgent in the moment.
                Figure out what time you need to do the most important parts of your job, and rebuild your daily and weekly schedule accordingly. Next, find out what minor or repetitive tasks you can delegate — who knows how happy and how aligned with Purpose someone else could be in doing those tasks?
                Crucially, next, assess what tasks you can batch and automate, and use tech to your advantage; simple automation of workflows can easily 2X your productivity all by itself.
                Schedule a quarterly check on your schedule, to see if the way you’re spending your time is still the best and most aligned way, and adjust where needed.
                Plan your time diligently and Purpose-aligned
                Plan the time for finding your Purpose. Plan the time for staying connected to it. Plan the time for self-care and for relationships. Plan time to connect with your peer-to-peer coach. Plan your work strategically.
                As you see: the management of time is one of the most important, crucial steps to not only overcome social media or smartphone addiction, but to become the best version of you that you could possibly be.
                To that order: keep an eye on your calendar daily, weekly, and monthly. Make your schedule more important, and make it a point to stick to your planning — including when you plan to do absolutely nothing.
                But be agile; leave space to be able to respond to spur-of-the-moment requests, and make a conscious choice to deviate from your planning whenever you see fit.
                Just keep checking yourself to make conscious choices to do spend your time and attention on those things, people, relationships, and taks that matter most to you.
                The easiest way to help you do that, is to create a schedule, to regularly meet with a human being to discuss your success in sticking to that schedule, and to regularly assess and adjust your schedule as needed. Finally, daily (bullet) journaling can greatly help in this area as well.
                So, my friend, there you have it. The five basic steps to quit social media addiction, and five advanced steps to go beyond that and become the best and most happy version of you that you could possibly be. I hope you find these helpful. I’d love to hear from you if you do.
